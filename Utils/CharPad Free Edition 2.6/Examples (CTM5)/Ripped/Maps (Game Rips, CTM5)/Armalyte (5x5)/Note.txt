For the sake of immediate visibility in CharPad, the maps have been horizontally 
shortened from their original widths of 256 tiles.

To restore their original widths, set the map width to 256 (tiles) and right-scroll
the data until the right-most edge of the map is not blank.

nb. Levels 4 and 7 are not featured because they don't use any character background.

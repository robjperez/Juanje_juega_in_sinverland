  </p>
  <p>
    <b>The Tile Set Form.</b>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>The Tile Set form allows you to view and organise the project's tiles and also perform
    multi-tile transformations.</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>Resizing the tile set (quantity)...</b>
  </p>
  <p>To set the quantity of tiles in the tile set, simply type a new quantity into the numeric
    entry box on the form's tool bar and hit ENTER.</p>
  <p>nb. The minimum quantity is 1 and the maximum is 65536.</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>Resizing the tile set (dimensions)...</b>
  </p>
  <p>To alter the dimensions of all the tiles in the set, select a new tile size from the
    drop-down list on the form's tool bar, all existing tiles will have their dimensions altered and
    their contents converted to retain the existing images as much as possible.</p>
  <p>nb. The smallest tile size is 1x2 or 2x1, the largest size is 10x10 (character images).</p>
  <br />
  

  <p><b>Selecting tiles...</b></p>
  <p>This version of CharPad allows you to specify two 'current' tiles, a 'primary tile',
     this is the one that also appears (for editing) in the Tile Editor, you can use the LEFT mouse button
     to specify a primary tile, it will appear highlighted and boxed by yellow vertical bars to indicate
     it's position in the set.</p> 

  <p>The primary tile is the one that will be used as a brush when drawing on the map using the 
     LEFT mouse button.</p>

  <p>A 'secondary tile' may be selected by using the RIGHT mouse button, it will appear boxed by
     red horizontal bars to indicate it's position in the set.</p>

  <p>The secondary tile will be used as a brush when drawing on the map using the RIGHT mouse
     button.</p>
 
  <p>To select a range of tiles, use the LEFT mouse button to select a primary tile, then hold 
     down the SHIFT key and select another primary tile, the selected range will appear highlighted.</p>
  <br />


  <p><b>Other functions...</b></p>
  <p>&#x2022; Swapping - By selecting a tile using the LEFT mouse button and then selecting a second
    tile using the LEFT mouse button whilst holding down the ALT key, the tile's positions in the set 
    can be swapped (alternated).</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Cropping - With a range of tiles selected, the 'Crop' menu item will remove all tiles not
    included in the selection.</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Cycling - With a range of tiles selected, the 'Cycle Backwards' and 'Cycle Forwards' menu
    items will cycle (rotate) the selected tile's positions in the set by one place.</p>
  <p>nb. Tile cycling does not perform correction on ie. map data, so the function can be used to
    produce an animation effect.</p>

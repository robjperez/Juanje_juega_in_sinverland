  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Exporting Data To Files.</b>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>CharPad can export data in a variety of ways...</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>Binary files...</b>
  </p>
  <p>These are plain (raw) binary files with no specific file-formatting and will only contain
    the data that has been exported.</p>
  <p>Character Sets : 8 bytes per character image (byte 0 = top pixel row of image 0 etc) for 
    however many character images.</p>
  <p>Character Set Attributes : 1 byte per image (upper nybble = Material, lower nybble =
    Colour).</p>
  <p>Tile Sets : TileWidth x TileHeight bytes per tile (byte 0 = top/left corner of tile 0) for
    however many tiles.</p>
  <p>Tile Set Attributes : 1 byte per tile (upper nybble = unused (0), lower nybble =
    Colour).</p>
  <p>Map : MapWidth x MapHeight bytes (byte 0 = top/left corner).</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>Text files...</b>
  </p>
  <p>CharPad can output a human-readble ASCII text file containing all the data for a project, it
    will be given the extension 'asm' as it can also be assembled (into machine code) by feeding it
    to a suitable 65XX CPU assembler program such as 64TASS.</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>Image files...</b>
  </p>
  <p>These can be either Microsoft Windows Bitmap (BMP) or Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
    format.</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>Shoot 'em Up Construction Kit (background) files...</b>
  </p>
  <p>Commonly referred to as SEUCK, the Shoot 'em Up Construction Kit was (and remains) a popular
    tool for making games on the Commodore 64.</p>
  <p>CharPad can output a background file in a format that is compatible with the Shoot 'em Up
    Construction Kit, it will contain a character set, a tile set and a map.</p>
  <p>nb. To be eligible for export as a SEUCK background, a CharPad project MUST have these
    properties...</p>
  <p>254 character images.</p>
  <p>128 (5x5) tiles.</p>
  <p>1 map (8 x 512).</p>
  <p>Colouring Method : Per Tile.</p>

  <p>To successfully import the background file into the SEUCK, you will have to add the file to a
    D64 disk image and make sure that the file name has exactly 16 characters and ends in ".B"</p>

  <p>ie. "BLUEBACKGROUND.B"</p>

  <p>The D64 disk image may then be used with the SEUCK, either using a Commodore 64 emulator or by
   transferring the D64 to a real floppy disk for use on a real
  machine.</p>

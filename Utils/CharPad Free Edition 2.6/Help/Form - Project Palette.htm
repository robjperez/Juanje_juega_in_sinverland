  </p>

  <p><b>The Project Palette Form.</b></p>
  <br />
  <p>The Project Palette form allows you to adjust various project options as well as define the
    project's colour scheme and select a current pen.</p>
  <br />

  <p><b>Pens...</b></p>
  &#x2022; Transparent : Background (screen) colour, choose from all 16 colours.
  <br />&#x2022; Char colour : The native colour value used to render a character (or tile). See notes.
  <br />&#x2022; Multi-colour 1 : Only available if multi-colour mode is enabled, choose from all 16
  colours.
  <br />&#x2022; Multi-colour 2 : Only available if multi-colour mode is enabled, choose from all 16
  colours.
  <br />
  <br />

  <p><b>Materials...</b></p>
  Use the left mouse button to set a material value (hex, 0-f) for the selected character(s). 
  <br />  
  <br />  

  <p><b>Char multi-colour mode...</b></p>
  &#x2022; Enabled : Any character using a char colour greater than 7 (yellow) will appear in
  multi-colour (4 colour) format.
  <br />&#x2022; Disabled : Characters can only use the high-resolution (2 colour) format.
  <br />
  <br />

  <p><b>Colouring method...</b></p>
  &#x2022; Global : All characters are rendered using the same colour.
  <br />&#x2022; Per Tile : All characters for a particular tile are rendered using the colour assigned to
  the tile.
  <br />&#x2022; Per Character : Each character is rendered using the colour assigned to it.
  <br />
  <br />

  <p><b>Tile system...</b></p>
  &#x2022; Enabled : The project can make use of a tile set, the map data refers to tiles.
  <br />&#x2022; Disabled : The project cannot use a tile set, the map data refers to characters.
  <br />
  <br />
 
  <p><b>Notes...</b></p>
  <p>If character multi-colour mode is enabled, the character set may use up to four colours in any
    character that uses a char colour greater than 7 (yellow) in the colour palette with the
    restriction that the character's horizontal resolution is halved and the actual char colour can
    only be one of the first 8 colours.</p>
  <p>If multi-colour mode is disabled, characters can only use two colours, the transparent colour
    and the char colour which can be any of the possible 16.</p>
  <p>On the Commodore 64, colour is not a property of character images, it is a property of the
    screen matrix cells in colour RAM and so a character's colour (and multi-colour status) will
    depend on the value assigned to the screen position (in colour RAM) the character is displayed
    in.</p>

    <b>The Map Editor Form.</b>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>The Map Editor form allows you to view and edit the project's map.</p>
  <br />

  <p>
    <b>Resizing the map...</b>
  </p>
  <p>This form's tool bar contains numeric entry boxes for displaying and changing the map's 
dimensions, to alter them simply type new values into the boxes and hit ENTER.</p>

  <p>nb. The smallest possible map size is 1x1, the largest is 8192 x 8192.</p>
  <br />


  <p><b>Panning...</b></p>

  <p>With the Pan tool selected, you can navigate around the map by clicking and dragging it with 
the LEFT mouse button, depending on the map dimensions this is usually quicker and more convenient 
than using the horizontal and vertical scroll bars.</p>
  <br />


  <p><b>Selecting a map area...</b></p>

  <p>With the Selection tool enabled, clicking on the map the LEFT mouse button will select a
    map cell.</p>

  <p>By clicking on a second map cell using the LEFT mouse button with the SHIFT key held down, 
a rectangular area of the map can be selected (it will appear highlighted).</p>

<p>When the Selection tool is active, a number of options become available in the Edit menu such
as Select All, Crop, Cut, Copy, Paste, Fill etc.</p>  
  <br />


  <p><b>Painting...</b></p>

  <p>With one of the Brush tools selected, map cells can be painted using the mouse.</p>

  <p>The LEFT mouse button paints using the current 'primary' brush and the RIGHT mouse button 
    paints using the current 'secondary' brush.</p>

  <p>With the flood-fill tool selected, areas of the map can be flood-filled, clicking the LEFT
mouse button while over the drawing canvas will flood-fill from the chosen spot using the current
'primary' brush and the RIGHT mouse button will flood-fill using the current 'secondary' brush.</p>

  <p>When using a Brush tool or the Flood-fill tool, the MIDDLE mouse button can be used to pick 
a new primary brush from the map.</p>
  <br />


  <p><b>Transformations...</b></p>

  <p>The following transformations are available when this form is active...</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Scroll (up, down, left, right).</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Flip (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Reflect (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>Notes...</b>
  </p>
  <p>-When the Map form is active, the main form offers the Scroll, Flip and Reflect operations
in the Edit menu, these can be performed on the whole map, or if the the Selector tool is enabled, 
these operations can be performed on just a currently selected area.</p>

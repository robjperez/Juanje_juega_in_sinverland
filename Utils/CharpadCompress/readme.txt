This program compress a Screen Map made with Charpad.
It's a very simple compression algorithm based on RLE.

Usage:

-Put in executable folder a Screen Map made with Charpad and exported as bin file.
-Rename it as "ScreenMap.bin"
-Execute "CompressScreenMap.exe" and a new file called "ScreenMapCompress.bin" will appear in the folder.

To ensure proper functioning I recommmend to delete old "bin" files in the folder.
